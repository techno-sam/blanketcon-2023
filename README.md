# BlanketCon 2023 Scripts
Various scripts written for the CC:R booth at [BlanketCon 2022], and adapted for [BlanketCon 2023].

Please note that many of these programs were hacked together (or at least
heavily modified) specifically for the con to quite a tight deadline. The code
quality is not the best, and they'll probably require a lot of modification to
make them work.

## Interesting projects
 - `src/slides`: Slideshow and Q&A system using [PictureSign] and a command
   computer.
 - `src/speaker`: Basic DJ program.

## Support projects
 - `src/gps`: GPS array which serves the whole server. Relatively uninteresting.
 - `src/no-terminate`: Wrapper script which prevents a user terminating the
    computer.
 - `src/watchdog`: Keeps computers powered on.
